""" Variable is a containers for storing the data values
Rules
names cannot start with the numbers
there can be no spaces in the name,use _ instead
can't use special characters : <> ? @ % +
it is considered best practice that the names are lowerase.
avoid using the words that have special meaning in python list 'list and 'str' etc
python uses dynamic typing (this means can reassign the variables to different data types

my_dogs = 2
my_dogs = ["sammy" , "frankee"]
this is totally okay in python

for find out the datatype use type() function

"""
a = 'shinoj'
print(a)
b = 3
print(b)

c = 5
print(c)
print(type(c))

print(type(a))

f = 1 + 7 - 6
print(f)
print(type(f))

a = 6.5
print(type(a))

my_income = 100
tax_rate = 2.5

print(my_income * tax_rate)
